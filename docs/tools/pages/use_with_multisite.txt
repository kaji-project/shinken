==== Using Shinken with Multisite ====

Multisite communicates with Shinken through the LiveStatus module. If you used the sample configuration, everything should be ready already. :)

You can review the configuration using the following steps.

=== Enable Livestatus module ===

See [[enable_livestatus_module|enable Livestatus module]].

=== Configure Multisite ===

Latest versions of Multisite are included into Check_MK, which must be fully installed although we will only use the web interface.

To install and configure Multisite manually, follow [[http://mathias-kettner.de/checkmk_multisite_setup.html|instructions at MK website]].

Best choice is to use Shinken **[[shinken_10min_start#method_1the_easy_way|install script]]** (In Shinken versions >1.0). With addons installation option (''./install -a multisite'') it is fast and easy to install and configure it as Multisite's default site.

<note warning>If you get some error installing Multisite related with unknown paths ("can not find Multisite_versionXXX") perhaps you must edit ''init.d/shinken.conf'' file and adjust MKVER variable (search for "export MKVER") with current stable available version of Check_MK as stated on MK website.</note>


== Check_MK install quick guide ==

  - Install check_mk: Detailed [[http://mathias-kettner.de/checkmk_getting_started.html|instructions]] there. Shell driven install with a lot of questions related with Check_mk install paths and integration with Apache and existing "Nagios". For Shinken some default answers must be changed to accomodate Shinken install.
  - Edit config file ''multisite.mk'', usually in ''/etc/check_mk'', to insert a new site pointing to Shinken and write Livestatus socket address as declared at [[enable_livestatus_module|Shinken's Livestatus module]]. Socket may also be an unix socket ("unix:/some/other/path").
  - Restart Apache.

''/etc/check_mk/multisite.mk'':
<code>sites = {
  "munich": {
      "alias": "Munich"
  },
  "Shinken": {
     "alias":          "Shinken",
     "socket":         "tcp:127.0.0.1:50000",
     "url_prefix":     "http://shinken.fqdn/",
   },
}</code>
<note>Replace "shinken.fqdn" with the complete URI to reach Shinken host from browser (not 127.0.0.1!). Used by PNP4Nagios's mouse-over images.</note>

If you plan to use Multisite only as web UI no more configuration is needed. Also you can disable WATO (Web Administration TOol) by including the line **wato_enabled = False** in ''multisite.mk''.
