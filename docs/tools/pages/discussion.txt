==== Introduction ====

Welcome to the global discussion page !

You can also suggest modifications, improvements or discuss the contents or layout of a page.

For technical support, bug reports, discussions for complex issues and feature requests please consult the [[::official:How to contribute]] pages for links to all user and developer resources.


Try to keep this page as clear as possible please :) \\
Few Rules: 
   * When you want to discuss a page that is not currently discussed, don't forget to put a link to   this  page at the top. For example: 
 <note>This page is being discussed [[discussion|here]], modification may occur in a little time. Feel free to help us !</note>

   * When you modify this page, don't forget to modify the last update time. It's easier to see activity :)


Thank you for the time you spend on the project and your help :)

==== Dev Corner ====

I've added a new page to gather minimum versions of packages and modules for the upcoming 1.2 version.

http://www.shinken-monitoring.org/wiki/dev_corner/prerequisites_1_2

There is a lot to complete and todo, for example fill in the version of course and the usage for which part. Then of course the sorting
in the sections etc. But I am just too fresh in this project to know this.
