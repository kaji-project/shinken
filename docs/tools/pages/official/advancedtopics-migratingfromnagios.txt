====== Migrating from Nagios to Shinken ======

===== How to to import existing Nagios states =====
It's possible with the //nagios_retention_file// module in fact.

**The "migration" is done in two phases :**
  - First you launch shinken with both NagiosRetention and PickleRetention modules. It will load data from NagiosRetention and save them in a more "efficient" file. So add in //shinken-specififc.cfg// file both modules for your scheduler object: <code>modules                 NagiosRetention ,PickleRetention</code>
  - Then you remove the NagiosRetention (it's a read only module, don't fear for your nagios retention file) and restart with just PickleRetention. <code>modules                 PickleRetention</code>
You're done.

<note important>This method has met with limited success, further testing of the NagiosRetention module is required. An issues encountered should be raised in the Shinken issue tracker on github.</note>

===== How to to import Nagios reporting data =====

There is no out of the box migration path for Historical reports.
