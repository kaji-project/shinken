===== Chapter 62. Shinken performance statistics =====
===== Introduction =====

Shinken provides some statistics in the log files on the health of the Shinken services. These are not currently available in the check_shinken check script. Support is planned in a future release. This will permit graphical review that Shinken :

  * Operates efficiently
  * Locate problem areas in the monitoring process
  * Observe the performance impacts of changes in your Shinken configuration


Shinken [[::internal_metrics|internal metrics]] are collected in the poller log and scheduler logs when [[start:troubleshooting_shinken|debug log level is enabled]].
