===== Chapter 25. Standard Macros in Shinken =====

Standard macros that are available in Shinken are listed here. On-demand macros and macros for custom variables are described [[:::official:thebasics-macros|here]].

===== Macro Validity =====

Although macros can be used in all commands you define, not all macros may be “valid” in a particular type of command. For example, some macros may only be valid during service notification commands, whereas other may only be valid during host check commands. There are ten types of commands that Nagios recognizes and treats differently. They are as follows:

  - Service checks
  - Service notifications
  - Host checks
  - Host notifications
  - Service [[:::official:advancedtopics-eventhandlers|event handlers]] and/or a global service event handler
  - Host [[:::official:advancedtopics-eventhandlers|event handlers]] and/or a global host event handler
  - [[:::official:configuringshinken-configmain#configuringshinken-configmain-ocsp_command|OCSP]] command
  - [[:::official:configuringshinken-configmain#configuringshinken-configmain-ochp_command|OCHP]] command
  - Service [[:::official:advancedtopics-perfdata|performance data]] commands
  - Host [[:::official:advancedtopics-perfdata|performance data]] commands

The tables below list all macros currently available in Shinken, along with a brief description of each and the types of commands in which they are valid. If a macro is used in a command in which it is invalid, it is replaced with an empty string. It should be noted that macros consist of all uppercase characters and are enclosed in $ characters.

===== Macro Descriptions =====

| Host Macros: [[:::official:thebasics-macrolist#thebasics-macrolist-note3|3]] ||
| [[|$HOSTNAME$]] | Short name for the host (i.e. "biglinuxbox"). This value is taken from the host_name directive in the [[:::official:configuringshinken/configobjects/host|host definition]]. |
| [[|$HOSTDISPLAYNAME$]] | An alternate display name for the host. This value is taken from the display_name directive in the [[:::official:configuringshinken/configobjects/host|host definition]]. |
| [[|$HOSTALIAS$]] | Long name/description for the host. This value is taken from the alias directive in the [[:::official:configuringshinken/configobjects/host|host definition]]. |
| [[|$HOSTADDRESS$]] | Address of the host. This value is taken from the address directive in the [[:::official:configuringshinken/configobjects/host|host definition]]. |
| [[|$HOSTSTATE$]] | A string indicating the current state of the host ("UP", "DOWN", or "UNREACHABLE"). |
| [[|$HOSTSTATEID$]] | A number that corresponds to the current state of the host: 0=UP, 1=DOWN, 2=UNREACHABLE. |
| [[|$LASTHOSTSTATE$]] | A string indicating the last state of the host ("UP", "DOWN", or "UNREACHABLE"). |
| [[|$LASTHOSTSTATEID$]] | A number that corresponds to the last state of the host: 0=UP, 1=DOWN, 2=UNREACHABLE. |
| [[|$HOSTSTATETYPE$]] | A string indicating the [[:::official:thebasics-statetypes|state type]] for the current host check ("HARD" or "SOFT"). Soft states occur when host checks return a non-OK (non-UP) state and are in the process of being retried. Hard states result when host checks have been checked a specified maximum number of times. |
| [[|$HOSTATTEMPT$]] | The number of the current host check retry. For instance, if this is the second time that the host is being rechecked, this will be the number two. Current attempt number is really only useful when writing host event handlers for "soft" states that take a specific action based on the host retry number. |
| [[|$MAXHOSTATTEMPTS$]] | The max check attempts as defined for the current host. Useful when writing host event handlers for "soft" states that take a specific action based on the host retry number. |
| [[|$HOSTEVENTID$]] | A globally unique number associated with the host's current state. Every time a host (or service) experiences a state change, a global event ID number is incremented by one (1). If a host has experienced no state changes, this macro will be set to zero (0). |
| [[|$LASTHOSTEVENTID$]] | The previous (globally unique) event number that was given to the host. |
| [[|$HOSTPROBLEMID$]] | A globally unique number associated with the host's current problem state. Every time a host (or service) transitions from an UP or OK state to a problem state, a global problem ID number is incremented by one (1). This macro will be non-zero if the host is currently a non-UP state. State transitions between non-UP states (e.g. DOWN to UNREACHABLE) do not cause this problem id to increase. If the host is currently in an UP state, this macro will be set to zero (0). Combined with event handlers, this macro could be used to automatically open trouble tickets when hosts first enter a problem state. |
| [[|$LASTHOSTPROBLEMID$]] | The previous (globally unique) problem number that was given to the host. Combined with event handlers, this macro could be used for automatically closing trouble tickets, etc. when a host recovers to an UP state. |
| [[|$HOSTLATENCY$]] | A (floating point) number indicating the number of seconds that a scheduled host check lagged behind its scheduled check time. For instance, if a check was scheduled for 03:14:15 and it didn't get executed until 03:14:17, there would be a check latency of 2.0 seconds. On-demand host checks have a latency of zero seconds. |
| [[|$HOSTEXECUTIONTIME$]] | A (floating point) number indicating the number of seconds that the host check took to execute (i.e. the amount of time the check was executing). |
| [[|$HOSTDURATION$]] | A string indicating the amount of time that the host has spent in its current state. Format is "XXh YYm ZZs", indicating hours, minutes and seconds. |
| [[|$HOSTDURATIONSEC$]] | A number indicating the number of seconds that the host has spent in its current state. |
| [[|$HOSTDOWNTIME$]] | A number indicating the current "downtime depth" for the host. If this host is currently in a period of [[:::official:advancedtopics-downtime|scheduled downtime]], the value will be greater than zero. If the host is not currently in a period of downtime, this value will be zero. |
| [[|$HOSTPERCENTCHANGE$]] | A (floating point) number indicating the percent state change the host has undergone. Percent state change is used by the [[:::official:advancedtopics-flapping|flap detection]] algorithm. |
| [[|$HOSTGROUPNAME$]] | The short name of the hostgroup that this host belongs to. This value is taken from the hostgroup_name directive in the [[:::official:configuringshinken/configobjects/hostgroup|hostgroup definition]]. If the host belongs to more than one hostgroup this macro will contain the name of just one of them. |
| [[|$HOSTGROUPNAMES$]] | A comma separated list of the short names of all the hostgroups that this host belongs to. |
| [[|$LASTHOSTCHECK$]] | This is a timestamp in time_t format (seconds since the UNIX epoch) indicating the time at which a check of the host was last performed. |

| [[|$LASTHOSTUP$]] | This is a timestamp in time_t format (seconds since the UNIX epoch) indicating the time at which the host was last detected as being in an UP state. |
| [[|$LASTHOSTDOWN$]] | This is a timestamp in time_t format (seconds since the UNIX epoch) indicating the time at which the host was last detected as being in a DOWN state. |
| [[|$LASTHOSTUNREACHABLE$]] | This is a timestamp in time_t format (seconds since the UNIX epoch) indicating the time at which the host was last detected as being in an UNREACHABLE state. |

| [[|$NOTIFICATIONISESCALATED$]] | An integer indicating whether this was sent to normal contacts for the host or service or if it was escalated. 0 = Normal (non-escalated) notification , 1 = Escalated notification. |
| [[|$NOTIFICATIONAUTHOR$]] | A string containing the name of the user who authored the notification. If the $NOTIFICATIONTYPE$ macro is set to "DOWNTIMESTART" or "DOWNTIMEEND", this will be the name of the user who scheduled downtime for the host or service. If the $NOTIFICATIONTYPE$ macro is "ACKNOWLEDGEMENT", this will be the name of the user who acknowledged the host or service problem.

Acknowledgements do not cause the notification number to increase, nor do notifications dealing with flap detection or scheduled downtime. |
| [[|$HOSTNOTIFICATIONID$]] | A unique number identifying a host notification. Notification ID numbers are unique across both hosts and service notifications, so you could potentially use this unique number as a primary key in a notification database. Notification ID numbers should remain unique across restarts of the Nagios process, so long as you have state retention enabled. The notification ID number is incremented by one (1) each time a new host notification is sent out, and regardless of how many contacts are notified. |
| [[|$SERVICENOTIFICATIONNUMBER$]] | The current notification number for the service. The notification number increases by one (1) each time a new notification is sent out for the service (except for acknowledgements). The notification number is reset to 0 when the service recovers (after the recovery notification has gone out). Acknowledgements do not cause the notification number to increase, nor do notifications dealing with flap detection or scheduled downtime. |
| [[|$SERVICENOTIFICATIONID$]] | A unique number identifying a service notification. Notification ID numbers are unique across both hosts and service notifications, so you could potentially use this unique number as a primary key in a notification database.

===== Notes =====

-1 These macros are not valid for the host they are associated with when that host is being checked (i.e. they make no sense, as they haven't been determined yet).

-2 These macros are not valid for the service they are associated with when that service is being checked (i.e. they make no sense, as they haven't been determined yet).

-3 When host macros are used in service-related commands (i.e. service notifications, event handlers, etc) they refer to the host that the service is associated with.

-4 When host and service summary macros are used in notification commands, the totals are filtered to reflect only those hosts and services for which the contact is authorized (i.e. hosts and services they are configured to receive notifications for).

-5 These macros are normally associated with the first/primary hostgroup associated with the current host. They could therefore be considered host macros in many cases. However, these macros are not available as on-demand host macros. Instead, they can be used as on-demand hostgroup macros when you pass the name of a hostgroup to the macro. For example: $HOSTGROUPMEMBERS:hg1$ would return a comma-delimited list of all (host) members of the hostgroup hg1.

-6 These macros are normally associated with the first/primary servicegroup associated with the current service. They could therefore be considered service macros in many cases. However, these macros are not available as on-demand service macros. Instead, they can be used as on-demand servicegroup macros when you pass the name of a servicegroup to the macro. For example: $SERVICEGROUPMEMBERS:sg1$ would return a comma-delimited list of all (service) members of the servicegroup sg1.

-7 These macros are normally associated with the first/primary contactgroup associated with the current contact. They could therefore be considered contact macros in many cases. However, these macros are not available as on-demand contact macros. Instead, they can be used as on-demand contactgroup macros when you pass the name of a contactgroup to the macro. For example: $CONTACTGROUPMEMBERS:cg1$ would return a comma-delimited list of all (contact) members of the contactgroup cg1.

-8 These acknowledgement macros are deprecated. Use the more generic $NOTIFICATIONAUTHOR$, $NOTIFICATIONAUTHORNAME$, $NOTIFICATIONAUTHORALIAS$ or $NOTIFICATIONAUTHORCOMMENT$ macros instead.

-9 These macro are only available as on-demand macros - e.g. you must supply an additional argument with them in order to use them. These macros are not available as environment variables.

-10 Summary macros are not available as environment variables if the [[:::official:configuringshinken-configmain#configuringshinken-configmain-use_large_installation_tweaks|use_large_installation_tweaks]] option is enabled, as they are quite CPU-intensive to calculate.
